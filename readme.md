ActionBarUX
===========

# Introduction

Google released some helpful libs at GoogleIO 2013 including 
actionbarcompat updated to support api 8, Volley Network lib 
to replace AsyncTask, etc so this a project to 
explore UX/Ui stuff based on that set of circumstances.


# Dependencies Android Support Libs

Its my understanding that for ActionBar support via the 
android support libs that Imust have both v4 and v7-appcompat
as project libs and for gird support Imust have v7-gridlayout.
